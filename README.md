# Drexel
Here is come code I found from my one and only semester at Drexel in the fall of 2004.

The exercise  was to transcribe Java code from a sheet of paper to a text editor. I remember
most students in that class had taken a programming course in high school and have already worked
with Java before.. My major was Information Systems, not Computer Science. The thought was IS was easier and
therefore I could maintain.

I left Drexel for 3, prioritized reasons: 1) I was homesick, 2) I had a terrible case of imposter 
syndrome, and 3) and the school was (and still is) too damn expensive.
