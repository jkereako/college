# Drexel
Here is some code I found from my one and only semester at Drexel in the fall of
2004. While this isn't the first code I wrote, it's certainly the most
advanced. Prior to this, the most complex routine I wrote was a PHP script which
printed text from a file. It was 3 lines.

# The exercise
The exercise  was to transcribe Java code from a sheet of paper to a text
editor. I remember most students in that class had taken a programming course in
high school and have already worked with Java before.. My major was Information
Systems, not Computer Science. The thought was IS was easier and therefore I
could maintain a respectable GPA.

# On a personal note...
I enjoyed my time at Drexel. I quickly made friends and really dug Philly. But I
I left Drexel anyway for 3 prioritized reasons: 1) I was homesick, 2) I had a
terrible case of imposter syndrome, and 3) and the school was (and still is) too
damn expensive (e.g. "the Drexel shaft").
